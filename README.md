This tutorial uses the express generator to build out an express backend that has a users database. There is no front end. The user must use Postman
in order to query the server. The application is located at:

https://mean-crud-cornjacket.c9users.io/todos

I used nodemon so that I could refactor and test without needing to quit and restart the server.
>npm install nodemon -g
